CAN'T LET YOU GO!
Only you know how I feel
Only you know what I miss
Can you see you're just what I need?
After all that we've been through
After all I've done for you
You should know my love is for real
Am I asking for too much?
Am I lwaiting for too long?
All I need is your tender touch
Don't you know I'm on my knees
Don't you know I'm begging please
Won't you take a look at me now?
No matter how hard I try
I can't get you off my mind
I just don't know what to do to have you back here again
I can't let go, can't let you go
I'm hurting don't you know
All my love goes to show
I can't go on without you
